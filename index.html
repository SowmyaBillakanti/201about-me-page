            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class="text"> Hello! My name is Seth Mcfeeters. 
                I moved from Mississippi to Seattle in 2013 and fell in like with the pacific northwest. 
                I learned how to snowboard the second year I was here and it quickly became my favorite pastime.
                for the last year I've been working on board the Victoria Clipper, which is a passenger ferry that goes from Seattle to Victoria B.C.
                I'm currrently a student at codefellows and this is my 2nd lab in code 102.
                I've been thinking about attending codefellows for the last few years, but didn't know where I'd find all that time, then COVID-19 cleared my schedule for me.
                sometime next year I'll be a salaried software devolper, so my mom can see me dosomething with my life and I can make her proud.
